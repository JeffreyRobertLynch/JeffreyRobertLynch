## About Me

**AI / ML Engineer & Educator** with contributions to **100+ projects** across **computer vision, LLM customization,** and **human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems**. Skilled in building **custom architectures, deploying models,** and designing **generalizable, production-aware workflows**. Specialized in **cognitive system design** and **explainable AI (XAI)** for high-stakes domains. **10+ years** of **leadership** and **instruction** experience. Recognized for excellence in both **engineering** and **communication**. 

---

## Key Differentiators

- **Full Lifecycle AI/ML Development**  
  From data ingestion and preprocessing to training, evaluation, deployment, and integration.
  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Deep suite including Grad-CAM, saliency maps, integrated gradients, layer visualization, overlay comparison, and more tools for interpretability and trust.
  
- **Human-AI Collaboration**  
  Systems thinking approach for aligning AI outputs with SME feedback and regulatory requirements.
  
- **High-Performance Architecture**  
  LLMs, CNNs, and U-Nets designed for maximum performance and transferability.
  
- **Communication, Teaching & Leadership**  
  Award-winning communicator with 10+ years of experience leading teams, mentoring talent, and delivering clarity across technical and non-technical audiences.

## Mission

I build human-aligned AI systems that are transparent, adaptable, and designed to work alongside experts. 

Humans and AI models have different cognitive strengths. We can leverage both most effectively by dividing tasks within a structured yet flexible system to support real-world workflows. 

My solutions are:

- **Human-Centric** – with XAI and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) design baked in.

- **Domain-Aware** - whether focused on medical imaging, precision agriculture, or HITL support for creative domains like television series development.

- **Auditable** – every layer, transformation, and decision pathway is visible.

- **Deployable** – from notebook to app, with API integration and user interfaces.

- **Actionable** – with interpretable results, stakeholder-aligned outputs, and embedded explainability.

Whether building a precision segmentation model from scratch or customizing an LLM for use in a UX-aligned HITL system, I approach each project as a full product. I apply system-level thinking, modern DL architecture, and a decade of instructional and leadership experience to deliver results that are technically rigorous, business-aware, and designed for trust.
