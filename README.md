## About Me

I’m an **AI/ML Engineer & Educator** with contributions to **100+ AI projects**, including end-to-end AI applications, explainable AI (XAI), and human-in-the-loop systems. I specialize in **deep learning for real-world applications**, with a focus on **Computer Vision**, **Generative AI**, and **interpretable XAI systems** designed for regulatory compliance, stakeholder communication, and public trust.

My background combines **deep technical expertise**, **systems-level engineering**, and **10+ years of instructional and leadership experience** across academic, cross-functional, and global teams.

## Key Differentiators

- **Full Lifecycle AI/ML Development**  
  From data ingestion and preprocessing to training, evaluation, deployment, and integration.
  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Deep suite including Grad-CAM, saliency maps, integrated gradients, layer visualization, overlay comparison, and more tools for interpretability and trust.
  
- **Human-AI Collaboration**  
  Systems thinking approach for aligning AI outputs with SME feedback and regulatory requirements.
  
- **High-Performance Custom Architecture**  
  Custom-built CNNs, U-Nets, ViTs, and GANs designed for maximum performance and transferability.
  
- **Communication, Teaching & Leadership**  
  Award-winning communicator with 10+ years of experience leading teams, mentoring talent, and delivering clarity across technical and non-technical audiences.

## Mission

I build AI that works in the real world — not black boxes, but clear, controllable systems that earn trust, meet regulations, and drive actionable outcomes.

Unlike plug-and-play approaches that rely on third-party APIs or opaque pretrained models, I specialize in from-scratch, ownable AI tailored to your data, infrastructure, and use case. My solutions are:

- **Auditable** – every layer, transformation, and decision pathway is visible

- **Deployable** – from notebook to app, with API integration and user interfaces

- **Actionable** – with interpretable results, stakeholder-aligned outputs, and embedded explainability

- **Secure & compliant** – no hidden licensing risks or external model dependencies

- **Iteratively improvable** – with XAI and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) design baked in

Whether building a precision segmentation model for clinical use or a scalable classifier embedded in an end-user tool, I approach each project as a full product — not just a model. I apply system-level thinking, modern ML architecture, and a decade of instructional and leadership experience to deliver results that are technically rigorous, business-aware, and designed for trust.
