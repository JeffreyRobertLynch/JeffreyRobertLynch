## Featured Projects

### 1. [GlassBox XAI: Attention U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation with Explainability Suite](https://github.com/JeffreyRobertLynch/GlassBox-XAI)
A high-performance medical image segmentation system built from scratch using a custom U-Net with attention mechanisms, trained on the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset. Features three variant models with performance trade-offs and a comprehensive XAI suite for clinical trust and regulatory compliance.

> Full code and methodology are not publicly available to protect intellectual property. Demos, metrics, model outputs, and XAI visualizations are fully accessible for review.

**Key Features:**
- Three variant models fine-tuned for different error profiles (false positives vs. false negatives) via custom loss functions.
- Achieved production-level performance benchmarks without pretrained models, ViTs, ensembling, or data beyond ISIC 2018.
- Performance metrics: Dice: 0.8751 | IoU: 0.8000 | Precision: 0.9028 | Recall: 0.8291 | Accuracy: 0.9272 | F1 Score: 0.8644
- XAI tools: Layerwise Grad-CAM, saliency maps, integrated gradients, pixel confidence maps, and confusion matrices.
- Modular image processing pipeline for augmenting training data and preprocessing test images.
- Comprehensive demo for both technical and non-technical audiences, showcasing system performance and interpretability.

---

**Highlights:**  
- High-performance medical image segmentation with a custom architecture and significant development constraints.
- Comprehensive application of XAI techniques for interpretability, transparency, and regulatory compliance.
- Advanced metrics-driven development using Dice, IoU, F1 score, and custom loss functions (Dice, Tversky, Hybrid).
- Exploration of performance trade-offs via optimizing variant models for specialized goals.
- Modular, reproducible, and generalizable workflow for efficient deployment.
- Extensive research, experimentation, and domain-aware development to address real-world challenges.
